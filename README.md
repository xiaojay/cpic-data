# cpic-data - Data produced by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PharmGKB/cpic-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PharmGKB/cpic-data)

This repo contains semi-structured data as defined in [publications](https://cpicpgx.org/publications/) written by CPIC.


## Translation Tables

The `translations` folder contains tab-separated value (TSV) files containing allele definitions and other related information like variant frequency. Each file corresponds to a gene. 


This data has been generated by [CPIC](https://cpicpgx.org) and curated by [PharmGKB](https://www.pharmgkb.org).


## Code

This repo has contains code for analysing the allele translation tables. 


### Build

The code in this repo is mostly Java (JDK8 to be precise) and uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org) for building. To build and test this project make sure you have both JDK8 and Gradle installed.

Use the following to build and test the codebase.

```
> gradlew build
```

Currently, this will validate the allele translation tables in the `translations` directory.
