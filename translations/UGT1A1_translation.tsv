Alleles are derived from the UDP-Glucoronosyltransferase (UGT) Alleles Nomenclature page (http://www.pharmacogenomics.pha.ulaval.ca/cms/site/pharmacogenomics/ugt_alleles). See https://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA420 for updates on UGT1A1 gene alleles and nomenclature.

An important caveat for all genotyping tests is that the decision to assign an allele a "wild-type" status is based upon a genotyping test that interrogates only the most common and already- proven sites of functional variation. In human DNA, it is always possible that a new, previously undiscovered (and therefore un-interrogated) site of variation may confer loss-of-function in an individual, and thus lead to the rare possibility of a non-functional allele being erroneously called as "wild-type".
UGT1A1*60 is in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with *28 and to date, there are no data to suggest that *60 by itself results in decreased UGT1A1 function.
Average frequencies are based on the actual number of subjects with each allele as reported in one or multiple studies.  For full details and references of allele frequencies, see https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/atazanavir/2015/26417955-UGT1A1_allele_frequency.xlsx
